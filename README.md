<ul>
<ii>Publish and subscribe to streams of records, similar to a message queue or enterprise messaging system</ii>.
<li>Store streams of records in a fault-tolerant durable way.</li>
<li>Process streams of records as they occur.</li>
</ul>

Kafka is generally used for two broad classes of applications:
<ul>
<li>Building real-time streaming data pipelines that reliably get data between systems or applications </li>
<li>Building real-time streaming applications that transform or react to the streams of data</li>
</ul>
